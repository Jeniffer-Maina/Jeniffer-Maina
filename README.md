Hi, I'm Jeniffer-Maina, a student pursuing computer programming at IYF and also a fourth year student at JKUAT pursuing B.Sc in Actuarial Science
I'm really interested in coding as it will be a great help, especially in the actuarial field when simulating and cleaning data
You can reach me at maina.jeniffer@students.jkuat.ac.ke
